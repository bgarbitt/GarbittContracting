- Mulching is a land clearing process that uses spinning steel blades to grind down trees into small pieces of bark called mulch. Mulched material can later be used to conserve soil moisture, moderate soil temperature, and supress weed growth. Mulching is useful in land clearance but also has agricultural uses as described here: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulch"" target=""_blank"">Wikipedia Mulch Link</a>.
- Our oilfield labour crews have all the tickets and training necessary to perform labour work in various types of oil fields.
- Tree trimming: Sometimes trees or other vegetation may pose a risk when growing near equipment, houses, or power lines. Rather than completely removing the tree/vegetation, sometimes it is possible to still save the tree by removing some branches, or it is visually more appealing, or it is just cheaper.
- Tree Removal: We have various methods of removing trees such as: Using giant mulching machines (quickly take down many trees), using a machine to securely grab medium sized trees and cut them horizontally to neatly set them down.
